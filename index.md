Welcome to my non-Departmental webpage and home of the MOSAIC research team!

MOSAIC is a research group at the Department of Chemistry, University of Antwerp. We use molecular scale simulations to unravel surface chemistry reaction mechanisms, in three research domains: atmospheric aerosol chemistry, astrochemistry, and catalysis for environmental applications.

Our computational toolbox consists of classical and ab initio molecular dynamics, density functional theory calculations, and enhanced sampling techniques.
